# Pelorus

## A website and desktop app with two main features:

- Display your school schedule and classes, loaded from an online Compass calendar file
- General purpose to-do list + note taking

## Things still to do:

- Implement json config saving
- Use json config to remember window positions instead of a node module
- Implement global error handling
- Add comments into code and make a good logging system
- Actually learn react and swap out the react template for an actual app

**Built with React and Electron!**
